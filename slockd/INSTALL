Prerequisites
=============

Linux 2.4+ or BSD 4+
perl 5.6+ (5.8 is recommend)
CPAN
gcc
make
development tools

Perl modules
------------
Net::DNS
POSIX
Fcntl
Digest::MD5
Digest::SHA1
Digest::HMAC
Net::IP

Step by Step installation
=========================

1) download tar ball

Go to http://www.extmail.org/download/ to get the latest version
source tar ball.

2) unpack tar ball

Unpack source tar ball and rename to slockd, replace the {version}
to the latest version number, eg:

$ tar xfz slockd-{version}.tar.gz
$ mv slockd-{version} slockd

move slockd source to /usr/local/slockd, first su to root, then
execute mv command:

$ su root
# mv slockd /usr/local

3) install perl module

Slock greatly depend on DNS operation, you must install the latest
Net::DNS module, since 0.5x Net::DNS need Net::IP module, and also
need Digest::HMAC and MD5/SHA1 module.

Download the following module from http://search.cpan.org

Net-DNS
Digest-HMAC
Digest-MD5
Digest-SHA1
Net-IP

Unpack source tar ball, then do:

$ cd Digest-MD5-xxx
$ perl MakeFile.PL
$ make
$ make test
$ su
# make install

After successfully install MD5 module, you need to install SHA1
and HMAC as the same way.

4) install Net::DNS

Before install the Net-DNS module, you must install Net-IP module
first, please refer to 3) if you don't know how to install it.

After Net-IP installation, it's the right time to install Net-DNS

$ tar xfz Net-DNS-0.5x.tar.gz
$ cd Net-DNS-0.5x
$ perl MakeFile.PL
$ make
$ make install

When perl is generating Makefile for you, you will be prompt to
enable or disable test, type no.

5) Config slockd

# cd /usr/local/slockd

Edit config/main.cf, you will see the main configuration for
slockd, every config parameter has comment on it, read them
carefully before any change.

Slockd will listen to only the localhost, port 10030, and throw
any infomation to the STDERR.

The minimal change should take is to change the pid_file and
log_file path to appropriate place, eg:

pid_file   /var/run/slockd.pid
log_file   /var/log/slockd.log

6) Config your resolv.conf

Edit your /etc/resolv.conf and make sure you have a fast dns
server, if possible install a local cache dns server will gain
great performance.

7) Startup and test

Run it on command line:

# ./slockd

It will startup and accept connection, debug infomation will
throw to the stderr, on another console or terminal, enter
tools directory and run the following command:

perl policy_sig -h localhost -p 10030 --helo FOOBAR \
--ip 192.168.0.1 --from test@163.com --to test@bar.com

If the programe return:

action=551 see http://bl.extmail.org/cgi/why?spf=test@163.com

it means slockd works.

You can do more test by replacing --helo, --ip, --from and --to
to other value to see what will retrun from slockd.

8) Config Postfix or other MTA

Currently according apf plugin/patches, slockd can serve Postfix,
sendmail and qmail.

This document only cover how to config the Postfix mta, other
config for sendmail and qmail coming soon.

Edit /path/to/postfix/main.cf

Add "check_policy_service inet:127.0.0.1:10030" entry to the
smtpd_recipient_restrictions, the following is recommand setting:

smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
  permit_mynetworks,
  permit_sasl_authenticated,
  reject_non_fqdn_hostname,
  reject_non_fqdn_sender,
  reject_non_fqdn_recipient,
  reject_unauth_destination,
  reject_unauth_pipelining,
  reject_invalid_hostname,
  check_policy_service inet:127.0.0.1:10030

9) Reload Postfix

Reload postfix, wait and monitor the maillog, to see whether the
Postfix query slockd and reject UCE.

10) Daemonize slockd

After you make sure that slockd works well, you can config it
as a background daemon.

Edit config/main.cf, uncomment log_file and config to a suitable
path, eg: /var/log/slockd.log, uncomment setsid then set to 1:

setsid	1

then call slockd in command line:

./slockd

The slockd will startup and run in background.

11) Initialize script

There is a simple initialize script for slockd to start , stop and
restart, at the top of slockd source tree. run it as:

./slockd-init start
./slockd-init stop
./slockd-init restart
./slockd-init status

You can add the following line into /etc/rc.d/rc.local

/usr/local/slockd/slockd-init start
