Prerequisites
=============

see README

INSTALL steps
===============

This is the second version of INSTALL, it's simple and crude, only conver
how to setup a CGI version extmail. Please follow the steps describe here,
hope it would make sense. If you want a faster solution, please refer to
README.fcgi, it provide flexible FCGI acceleration guide, with FCGI you
will get 10-100 times performance improvment, and it will turn extmail
to a high performance web application :-)

Step1 - Download
================

Get the latest source from the official ExtMail website:
http://www.extmail.org/download/

unpack the source tar.gz and copy to /var/www/extsuite/, rename the
extmail-1.xxx to extmail

Step2 - Configure
=================
Before you begin to config apache and extmail, make sure that apache build
with at least mod_cgi support. Refer to apache manual for cgi information
in detail.

Here we only conver the standard cgi configuration;

please put the following cgi script to /path/to/cgi-bin/ of your apache
installation, chmod +x to it and point browser to the script, if it works
then cgi module is ok.

#!/usr/bin/perl
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
print "Hello world!\n";

You should see Hello world! if mod_cgi enabled and configured properly.

*) Apache + Suexec
Currently we recommend and *only* support apache + suexec installation,
for maximum flexibility and facility reason.

Make sure your apache build in Suexec, generally common Linux or BSD-like
OS will come with some pre-complie apache packages, eg RPM or PKG.

Most of them have suexec builtin. If you build apache manualy, please en-
sure that suexec activated and works correctly, refer to suexec manual for
more information and configration.

1)Add a new virtual host to apache, example configuration is:

NameVirtualHost *:80
<VirtualHost *:80>
ServerName mail.example.com
DocumentRoot /var/www/extsuite/extmail/html/
ScriptAlias /extmail/cgi /var/www/extsuite/extmail/cgi
Alias /extmail /var/www/extsuite/extmail/html
SuexecUserGroup vuser vgroup
</VirtualHost>

The SuexecUserGroup derective contain user/group that suexec will su to.
Make sure that your email system MDA will deliver email as that uid/gid,
or will cause permission problem.

2)Then chown the uid/gid of /var/www/extsuite/extmail/cgi/ to vuser/vgrop,
including the direcotry. Su to root:

# chown -R vuser.vgroup /var/www/extsuite/extmail/cgi/

*)Apache + uid/gid change

This is another way to run extmail with less security problem. Configuration
is easy, change User and Group directives in httpd.conf to the uid/gid of
maildir, for example your maildir own by vuser/vgroup, then change User and
Group to:

# vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

User vuser
Group vgroup

Save httpd.conf

Config extmail
==============
1)Restart apache, and try to access http://mail.example.com/, your browser
will be redirected to /extmail/cgi/index.cgi if everything works fine.

2)Configure /var/www/extsuite/extmail/webmail.cf

copy the webmail.cf.default as webmail.cf, then edit webmail.cf

Change SYS_AUTH_TYPE to your favorite type, ldap or mysql, and fill out
SYS_MYSQL_* parameters if you chose mysql, the same as ldap.

Please read webmail.cf for parameters explanation in detail.

3)Try to login with your existing account and password.

Step3 - Debug
=============

* openLDAP

Su to root and shutdown slapd, then run:
/usr/sbin/slapd -d 256

This command will invoke slapd in debug mode, then try to login webmail
to see how the searh procedure is happening.

* MySQL

Edit /etc/my.cnf and add the following:

[mysqld]
log=/var/lib/mysql/sql.log

Then all SQL statement will be written to /var/lib/mysql/sql.log, check
this log and see whether the SQL is correct or not.
